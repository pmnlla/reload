*"FPGAs work like this. You don't tell them what to do, you tell them what to BE."*

An FPGA is a chip that can be configured on the hardware level. You can basically make your own CPU and GPU on it.

The PCB called is "anice":
- 256MiB of ram
- 128MiB of flash
- HDMI port
- triple USB C with JTAG converter
- SDCard Reader
- dual 25MHz clock and 200MHz built-in clock
